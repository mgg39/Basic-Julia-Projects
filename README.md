# Basic-Julia-Projects
This repository contains some of my old Julia code, that I wrote at the start of my coding journey.

Current projects in this repository are:

-A calculator that transforms a kg or lb measured weight on earth to its equivalent in various planets. The "translations" are based in the following table of conversion:

-A Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

-A number guessing game.
